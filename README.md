# FindDate
I made a C# program that takes the followings from the user separately: Two dates (day, month, and year) later than 01.01.2015  A positive number (n) and then prints each n th day between given dates. The program must also print the day of the week (i.e., Monday) and the season (Winter, Spring, Summer, or Autumn)
